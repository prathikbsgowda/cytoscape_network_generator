Kinase-Substrate Network Visualization

Overview

This project provides a web-based interface for visualizing kinase-substrate networks using Cytoscape.js. Users can upload data files to generate interactive network graphs and download the visualizations as PNG or JPG images.

Features

Upload data files to generate network graphs.

Interactive graph visualization with Cytoscape.js.

Download generated graphs as PNG or JPG images.

User-friendly interface with styled controls.

Data Format

The data file should be in a tab-delimited format with two columns: kinase and substrates. Each row represents a kinase and its corresponding substrates. Substrates should be separated by semicolons.

Example Data

kinase	substrates
AKT1	ABLIM1_S455; ABLIM3_S372; AFAP1_S277; AFDN_S1083; AGO2_S387
EGFR	DNAJC5_Y17; EGFR_Y1172; MAPK14_Y182; TNS3_Y780; YES1_Y426
MAPK1	ARAF_S373; BRAF_S365; CRAF_S338; MEK1_S218; MEK2_S222

Usage

Open the HTML file in a web browser.

Click the "Choose File" button to upload a data file (e.g., Excel file).

Once the graph is generated, the download buttons will appear.

Click the "Download PNG" or "Download JPG" button to save the graph as an image.

Dependencies

Cytoscape.js: For graph visualization.

XLSX: For reading Excel files.

FileSaver.js: For saving files.

Notes

Ensure that the data file is in the correct format for proper graph generation.

The interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive.
